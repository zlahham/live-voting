###Summary

- Live-voting is a realtime polling/voting tool that can be used in situations which have one person speaking in front of an audience.
- The primary benefit of using this tool is to get a quick heartbeat response from your audience. Or as we like to call it, a quick litmus test.
- A few example usages:
	- Educational context
	- Conferences
	- Annual General Meetings
	- Conference calls
- For a more in depth overview of our journey as a team through this project, please see the corresponding [wiki](https://github.com/zlahham/live-voting/wiki).

####Local Testing
**NOTE**: You need to have Firefox installed if you want the tests to run properly, as we are using `selenium-webdriver` to run the JS tests. If you would like to use `capybara-webkit` instead, you can just uncomment line 23 in the Gemfile and comment line 24, followed by running `bundle`.
```
cd live-voting
